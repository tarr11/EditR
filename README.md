EditR
=====

A collaborative editor based on SignalR

The idea is to use the Wire format defined by ShareJS, but create a SignalR channel instead.  

This will allow us to leverage all the client code that has been written for ShareJS (ie, textarea, ACE, CodeMirror, etc)

We can then focus on creating a F# / SignalR server.
